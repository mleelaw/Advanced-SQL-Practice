# SQL Practice Queries

This repository contains my practice SQL queries created while completing the SQL course at Nashville Software School (NSS). The course covers foundational database concepts, query building, and advanced SQL features.

## About This Repository

This collection of queries represents my learning journey through the NSS SQL curriculum. The files are organized to follow the course structure, with examples demonstrating concepts like:

- Basic queries (SELECT, WHERE, JOIN)
- Subqueries
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions
- Views, stored procedures, and triggers
- Database optimization techniques

## Note

These queries are for educational purposes. They demonstrate SQL concepts taught at NSS and represent my personal practice and learning. Some queries may be specific to the database structure used in the course.
